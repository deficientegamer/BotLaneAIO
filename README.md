# BotLaneAIO
This repo is an GOS-EXT AIO for BotLane Champs. 

# The Project
AIO created by Accessibility Soldier so that it is possible for disabled people to play games as equals.
This AIO will exist and will be evolved until the day when the company developing the game creates the necessary features for disabled people to play as equals.
